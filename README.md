# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
analysis and engineering with postgres SQL

## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard wanted to know how many current employees will soon be up for retirement. They also wanted to know how many current employess, who are not up for retirement just yet, would be eligible to mentor incoming employees to replace the lost numbers. This analysis and project was conducted to provide the company with several tables of relevant data, and to give them numbers to work with as they manage the next several years as the baby-boomers in the company retire.
## Results

- Overwhelmingly, positions held by baby-boomer employees are in Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. This means that company is going to have a significant number of Senior Engineers and Senior Staff members to replace, or possibly reconsider the necessity of some of those positions. I anticipate that some mid-level employees will be promoted while new Senior level positions are filled by experienced recruits from the outside, who are making career changes, moving, etc.
- Overall, the company stands to lose 72,458 employees in the next few years as people decide to retire, although that decision is not guaranteed. 
- ![retiring_vs_mentors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100614266/166166891-143fbf53-a1b1-46a6-a654-bb285b0d01c3.png)
- In terms of mentors, with 72,458 employees reaching retirement age and anticipating them choosing to do so, that means about 70,000 positions that need to be filled, either through promotions of existing staff and then recruiting entry-level workers, or recruiting experienced industry veterans. Most likely it will be a mixture of both. With that in mind, for best quality of mentorship, 1:1 would require 70,000 current and experienced employees be eligible. For a ratio of 1:3, it would still require around 20,000 eligible mentors. 
- There are only 1,549 current employees that have eligibility to be mentors, according to the criteria set by the company. 

## Summary
- 72,458 positions will need to be filled on a rolling basis over the next several years as those eligible for retirement start to cycle out. 
- Since there are 1,549 eligible mentors, and 72,458 possible mentees, resulting in a ratio of 1:46 (1 mentor would have to manage an average of 46 mentees), there are not enough mentors available to provide quality mentorship to the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees.
